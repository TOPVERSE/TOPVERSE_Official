In terms of academics, VAMX™ will launch an academic community with university members and graduates to share augmented/mixed reality technology and Web 3.0 Metaverse creative projects, academic publications, international conferences, business development and other academic activities. At the same time, this is an independent community, and the main role of the platform is to share academic research, application development, student works or researchers' practices in the field of mixed reality in forms of include but not limited to: public official account articles, regular online and offline sharing sessions, project co-construction, etc. 

<h2>About UCL Bartlett RC-9: Architecture in Augmented Age</h2>

![Img](/imgs/Release/vamxlaunch/006.png) 

As we immerse ourselves in the rapidly evolving world of Extended Reality, the boundary between man and machine blurs, and portable devices enhance our awareness of our environment. XR has the ability to assist the process, leveraging data previously exclusive to machines to enhance human-machine interaction while enabling a seamless blend of intuitive decision-making and experience that is often lacking in automated construction processes. XR technology can also fundamentally change the way people interact and experience the built environment, enhancing or changing or adding new layers of information to the surrounding environment. 

Research Cluster 9 explores how XR technology is changing the way we design, build and interact with our environments. Therefore, ideas such as augmented manufacturing, industrial industrial economic development, or digital platforms for multi-person design and distributed manufacturing, as well as immersive experiences and interactions with the built environment and the metaverse, will be at the core of all research paths.
