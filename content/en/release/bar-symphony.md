"The Bar Symphony" is the first interactive interactive bar designed by TOPVERSE® Lab on the world's largest decentralized virtual real estate platform Decentraland at the invitation of Metaverse Union of Architects (MUA). Metaverse Bar.

It indicates a vague but at the same time unknown resonance between Metaverse users (bar-goers) who admire, love, chase, hate, and may not even know each other. The main movement of the building emerges from a simple circle, the overlapping of curves reflecting the language of Intertwined and Morphing. The building mainly consists of three façades in response to "Metaverse Classicism". At the top is the constantly jumping "Rhythm Ring", whose beating frequency is extracted from the beats of different musical styles.

The "stage jukebox" in the middle can hold parties of various music styles according to the preferences of visitors, and the "Speak-Easy Lounge" in the lower part contains more commercial and exhibition functions, including digital collection galleries, souvenir sales, press conferences, etc. Let more conversations take place in this building and explore more possibilities for metaverse social interaction.

In addition, we specially designed an NPC bartender-Hermit for this unique metaverse bar, which is the image of a sedentary hermit, and the red and blue energy rings are moving up and down regularly. I hope that people can maintain their inner peace while pursuing warm and intimate social interaction.
