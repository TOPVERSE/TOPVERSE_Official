Project Overview
===
The cooperation between TOPVERSE® and Xiamen Branch of China Tower Co., Ltd. lasted for nearly a year. Based on the "Notice of Fujian Provincial Department of Ecology and Environment on Carrying out the Pilot Work of Smart Supervision of Rural Domestic Sewage Improvement and Treatment", "Xiamen City Ecological The Environmental Protection Commission Office’s Notice on Printing and Distributing the Operational Monitoring and Monitoring Work Plan of Rural Distributed Sewage Treatment Facilities (Xia Huan Wei Ban [2021] No. 12)” and other documents, the proposed double-carbon water workstation on the innovative monitoring of rural domestic sewage treatment Mixed reality (MR) industrial metaverse solution, including three modules: visual monitoring, MR inspection, and dual carbon solar storage.

This case directly hits the traditional management model of rural domestic sewage treatment stations due to their large number and scattered distribution, which takes a long time to manage, difficult to investigate, and slow to respond, and the following pain points: 
1. The cost investment is high, and most of the methods are manual area inspections, which result in huge labor costs and a high turnover rate;
2. Weak regulatory means, low degree of informatization, lack of data collection channels, unable to meet the data needs of scientific management and precise decision-making;
3. The management method is passive, and the equipment cannot be actively managed and controlled when the equipment is accidentally damaged or an emergency occurs, and the efficiency is low;
4. The site assets are complex, there are many on-site equipment and pipelines are dense, and the equipment bill of materials cannot be automatically generated, and the underground concealed project lacks effective means of display.

In order to solve the management weakness of rural domestic sewage treatment stations, respond to the policy call for carbon neutrality and green industry, and based on the background needs of metaverse and digital twins for digital industrial transformation, the Xiamen Xiangan Dual Carbon Water Workstation Mixed Reality (MR) was designed as a practice of industrial metaverse solution, assisting in the promotion of digitization, technology and precision of sewage treatment work.

The rural domestic sewage monitoring system is based on the Internet of Things technology and information technology, with the cloud as the core, and adopts a three-layer network architecture. The bottom layer is information acquisition and control equipment, the middle layer is network transmission and cloud platform, and the top layer is the application layer, such as As shown in the figure. Among them, the information acquisition and control equipment includes water quality monitoring, video monitoring, flow, liquid level monitoring, electric energy monitoring, etc. of the sewage treatment station; the network transmission and cloud platform includes the low-power ad hoc wireless sensor network and the mobile Internet in the sewage treatment station to realize Centralized management, storage and intelligent processing of data on the cloud platform.

The mixed reality (MR) industrial metaverse system of water workstations is based on digital twin technology and augmented reality technology. The bottom layer is information acquisition and control equipment, the middle layer is network transmission and data management, and the top layer is the application layer. Among them, the information acquisition and control equipment includes water quality monitoring, video monitoring, flow, liquid level monitoring, pharmaceutical and equipment operation monitoring of sewage treatment stations, etc.; network transmission and data management include digital twin equipment and mobile Internet in sewage treatment stations to realize data in the sewage treatment station. Centralized management, storage and intelligent processing on the sewage treatment platform. The application layer includes an augmented reality application module, an intelligent monitoring management module, a service evaluation feedback module, etc. The software supports various levels and types of devices such as Microsoft HoloLens 1st and 2nd generation head-mounted displays, Android phones, and portable computers.

In terms of the visualization of sewage treatment principles, through the technical assistance of augmented reality, visitors can interact with the site through the system, which improves the user's sense of participation and standardization. The working interface displays the 3D model, displays the work steps of checking the grid pool through animation, 3D interaction, etc., identifies and locates the task identification points through the spatial anchor point, and performs operation specification guidance, data display and 3D model interaction according to the inspection process. 

This functional module can not only standardize the daily work of the inspectors, but also deepen their understanding of the working mechanism of the sewage treatment station, and build a complete operation specification and knowledge sharing system. Especially in the case of high mobility of inspectors, it is possible to quickly familiarize inspectors with job responsibilities and standardize their operations. 

Dual-Carbon Photovoltaic Module

The dual-carbon solar-storage system is a power-taking and energy-saving system tailored for rural domestic sewage treatment stations in combination with the characteristics of few buildings around the treatment station, difficulty in leading and obtaining electricity, and high construction costs. This system is a secondary development and utilization of the space resources of the sewage treatment station. While optimizing the power supply mode of the station, it also maximizes the resource utilization of the station. 

For the first time in this case, a visualization system, a water workstation mixed reality (MR) system, and a dual-carbon solar-storage system were used to connect a series of work around rural sewage treatment to form a complete closed loop of "perception-analysis-alarm-response-calibration-standardization" , to ensure the stability, efficiency and economy of rural sewage treatment. Through this application scenario, key data such as various survey and design data, construction information, completion data, intelligent sensing real-time monitoring data and business dynamics of sewage treatment stations and management networks are integrated into the Hologram mixed reality model, using technology, vivid and intuitive The process design and operation of the site are displayed in a manner, and a visual, component-level digital asset operation and management mechanism is formed.

Using digital twin technology to visually display the construction method, structure and process flow of the sewage treatment plant, you can clearly see the whole picture of the sewage treatment plant. You can also see the upper layer of the box, process pipelines, HVAC, automatic control appliances, The lower layer of the box body, the foundation pit and other specific structures. This application scenario can greatly improve the visualization and information intuitiveness of industrial projects of water workstations. Integrating water workstation information through digital twins can greatly reduce management costs, shorten early warning response time, and provide a more macroscopic data basis for information analysis of the water treatment industry and the updating and upgrading of subsequent technological processes.
