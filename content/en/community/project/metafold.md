MetaFold proposes a reusable and reconfigurable formwork system for on-site concrete casting. With augmented reality technology, MetaFold provides the users with real-time exchange of information on the construction progress through an augmented platform. This platform provides instructions for prefabrication of formwork, its assembly and reassembly on site, and the subsequent casting of concrete. Formwork is produced from flat metal sheets folded into shape following the holographic template. Once the casting process is finished, the formwork will be processed by the evaluation and selection system so as to determine which parts are suitable for creating new casting templates or internal partitions. Additionally, a design-to-fabrication application is developed in order to guide the user through the fabrication process and provide a ‘digital hand’ for both the designers and clients. To make the app smarter, the user interface has combined virtual reality technology with a generative design process by using remote synchronisation. The MetaFold app is one of the many attempts which emphasise strengthening the human-machine relationship while retaining human-centred factors through the augmented reality interface.
