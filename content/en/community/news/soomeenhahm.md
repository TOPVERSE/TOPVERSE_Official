<h2>About</h2>

SoomeenHahm Design Ltd is a London based design studio focusing on design research and practice tackling the issues of computational paradigm in architecture across multiple scales and perspectives. The research looks at the ecology of computational power, technology and human intuition and see how this collaboration impacts on the design industry and physical environment. Approached from strong academic drives, the office is trying to bridge between academic interest and commercial practices. Practical work produced in the office includes from small products to large architectural and urban design – experts in providing conceptual design solutions. Currently the office is interested in the use of Augmentation (ie AR/VR) to execute complex and precise digitally generated forms. Questioning the future role of human, robot, machine and computer.

Soomeen Hahm is the founder of the SoomeenHahm Design Ltd, a design researcher, educator and architectural designer. Academically she is currently a design faculty and robotic researcher at the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc). Soomeen gained her Bachelor of Architecture degree at the Beijing Tsinghua University and her Master of Architecture degree at the Architectural Association where she studied in the Design Research Lab (DRL). After her graduation, she developed her interests focusing on research in generative and algorithmic design using computer coding, application of multi-agent systems in design, interactive/responsive environments, behavioural patterns of natural systems, as well as robotic fabrication processes and digital modes of production. Her latest research focuses on AR/VR, wearable machines and human computer interaction. She is specialized in coding, digital simulations and 3d modelling in various software platforms. Since her graduation, Soomeen has taught and lectured at numerous institutions in UK and internationally, teaching studios, workshops and short courses focusing on computational design. In addition to this, she is contributing to various online educational platforms and digital toolset libraries. While participating in different academic events, she tries to tackle the issue of computational design paradigm in architecture across multiple scales, through collaboration and exchange of knowledge with other experts from the field. She is experienced in teaching design studios. She used to direct multiple design studios at the AA and the Bartlett. The design studio she directed at the Bartlett – BPro AD – developed series of innovative projects within architectural design discourse focusing on design and construction by augmented humans. She is also an experienced designer worked several years at Zaha Hadid Architects and Zaha Hadid Design where she engaged in designing some of the most iconic buildings and products.

Hanjun Kim is the associate of SoomeenHahm Design Ltd, an architectural designer and educator based in London. He is a course tutor at the Architectural Association Design Research Lab (AADRL) Master’s program in London and also a coordinator of the AA Visiting School Seoul. He completed his Master of Architecture degree at the AADRL and his Bachelor’s degree at Hongik University in Seoul, Korea.
He explores the realms of computation in architecture and design, the methodology of interactive ways between humans and technologies, while his recent research focuses on the use of Augmented Reality and gamification in architectural fields. He specializes in scripting, generative design, digital fabrication, and multimedia production. More broadly, he is also interested in autonomous systems, spatial networks of human behaviour with machine learning and artificial intelligence. He has previously worked in L’EAU Design in Seoul, where he led the design team for various projects with different scales. His experience in both academia and practice is spread over various aspects and spectrums in architectural design, from media, app, furniture, interior, architecture to urban design.

<h3>Augmented Grounds</h3> 
Augmented Grounds is a winning competition entry of the International Garden Festival 2020. It is a landscape design installation, located in the Métis garden, Prince, Quebeck, Canada, completed its construction in July 2020. The design is inspired by traditional Métis sash and the proposal uniquely combines technologies in its making process which was highly evaluated by the competition juries. 

The project utilized Augmented Reality and cloud based digital twin communication platforms in order to realize the construction during the pandemic. The project celebrates the fast and intuitive communication between designer and maker, utilizing the digitally augmented human labours crafting the delicate material on site by wearing AR Lenses. At the same time, a globally assembled team of designers were able to review the construction process through a cloud based digital twin of the construction site, being able to intuitively supervise the construction process from far distance and pass on knowledge and guidance to local crews efficiently. This enabled the global team of designers and makers to be able to work together simultaneously in distance during the design and construction process.
