<h2>About</h2>

Igor Pantic is an architectural designer and educator based in London, and the founder of Studio Igor Pantic Ltd. He works at the convergence of computational design, digital fabrication and immersive AR/VR technologies, exploring the ways in which these disciplines influence how we design, make and perceive built and virtual environments.  

Igor is a Lecturer at The Bartlett School of Architecture UCL in London, where he is teaching at B-Pro Architectural Design (AD) program, leading the research which focuses on the application of Mixed Reality technologies in architectural design and fabrication, operating at the overlap between low-cost AR assisted fabrication and automation. He is also a Lecturer at the University of East London UEL, where he is teaching MArch Unit 6. In addition to this, he has lectured and taught computational design workshops and seminars internationally, and has previously co-directed the AA Visiting School in Vienna.  

Prior to establishing his own design studio, Igor spent 7 years with Zaha Hadid Architects in London, during which he worked on a large number of high-profile projects across scales. Igor holds a Master degree from the Architectural Association Design Research Lab (AADRL) in London, and the Faculty of Architecture, University of Belgrade, Serbia.
