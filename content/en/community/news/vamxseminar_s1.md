<h2>About VAMX Seminar Series</h2>

With Apple's XR launch conference, everyone's understanding of XR has come a step closer, but besides the use of XR as advertised in the latest press conference, what usage scenarios can there be in the professional field of architecture? This month, co-sponsored by TOPVERSE and University College London (UCL) Bartlett RC-9, ArchiPocket jointly held the first VAMX Digital Research Group's first mixed reality technology forum, focusing on the application of mixed reality, augmented reality, extended reality and immersive technology in the fields of architectural design and intelligent construction. Compared with the traditional construction mode, technological breakthroughs have brought new opportunities. Enhanced crafting is a digital crafting method that combines digital tools and physical crafts. The enhanced process can be seen in newly developed tools (holographic devices including headsets or mobile devices) that can overlap virtual and real environments and provide holographic guidance in real time. In the case of repeated standardized use, this technology offers a high-precision, low-skilled technical possibility. It can replicate more of the human element in the manufacturing process, expanding the creator's experience and further developing the connection between the designer and the manufactured matter. Augmented processes may become the next step in digital processes by creating a dialogue between automated processes and processes. Today, more and more designers and architects are implementing AR technology in their projects.

The first online sharing session of VAMX invited Igor Pantic, RC9 tutor for the 2019-2020 school year, representatives of all RC9 research groups in 2020, and special guests from RC4 to bring you a comprehensive architectural XR enhancement process sharing discussion.


<h2>Guest Speakers and Recordings</h2>

<h3>1. Igor Pantic: Architecture in Augmented Age</h3>
<p align="center">

</p>

Igor Pantic is an architect specializing in digital design, based in London, where he leads his design and research practice. In his work, Igor explores how technology affects the way the environment is designed, manufactured and perceived. His current interests focus on the application of mixed reality technology in architectural design and fabrication, operating between low-cost AR-assisted manufacturing and automation.

Igor is currently a Lecturer in RC9 for the Architectural Design program at the UCL Bartlett B-pro program in London. He has lectured and taught computational design workshops and seminars internationally and has co-directed AA visiting schools in places such as Vienna. His previous work experience includes seven years with Zaha Hadid Architects, where he worked on a number of high profile projects. Igor holds a master's degree from the Architectural Association Design Research Laboratory (AADRL) in London and the Faculty of Architecture, University of Belgrade, Serbia. This time, he brought a keynote speech entitled "Architecture in Augmented Age".
